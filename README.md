# Topics and Documents - RoboTop

## Overview

Topic document modeling often consists of a clustering of documents and the simultaneous creation of a set of topics that characterize a cluster.  This is a bit of an over-simplification, as the correspondence between topics and documents does not have to be one-to-one, and the methodology can be adjusted in many ways.
In this project, I applied topic document modeling to a corpus of 15000 news articles.  I developed an iterative procedure to tighten up the topics and to limit their number.  The approach gives reasonable results, evaluated either by coherence and perplexity scores or by manual inspection of the resulting topic - document correspondence.

## Data

The corpus used is 15000 articles from 15 US publications.  I am not including the corpus on GitHub.  It is available at

The entire data set is 143000 articles.  I chose to work with a subset of 15000, 1000 from each of the publications. This number seemed adequate for my purposes.
